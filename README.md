Welcome to the Ethermist!
=======

The Ethermist is both a dimension mod and a magic mod. The main features are two fold:

1. A magic system using Minecraft's enchanting system. Find Orbs in the world (any dimension!) that can be crafted
    into a wand with effects dependent on the orb. You can then enchant your wand with a few types of enchantments:
    Base enchantments that change the wand stats, Augment enchantments that change how the wand shoots, Exclusion
    enchantments that filter what you can hit, and Main enchantments. These main enchantments are the "spice" of the mod,
    seriously affecting how your wand behaves - the Fireball enchantment, for example, turns your projectiles into a big
    explosion.
2. A new dimension, the Ethermist. This dimension serves as a mystical, mysterious place full of new blocks, structures, 
    and cool new bosses to use your new magical wands on. You can get here by building a portal out of Ethermist blocks found
    in structures scattered around the Overworld, and ignite it using any wand.

Installation
============
The mod will be installable on both Modrinth and CurseForge when it is released. There are currently no dependencies.

Wiki 
==========
After the mod is officially released, I will begin work on a wiki to help out with enchantments and info on new mobs,
especially bosses and their mechanics.

Issues
======
Please report all issues to the GitHub issue tracker. I will do my best to work out any incompatibilities with other mods,
but I will most likely not see these if they are posted in comments.

If this mod actually becomes popular enough, I will consider backports and ports to other modloaders.
